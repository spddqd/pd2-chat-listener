Small python utility to watch the chatlog of Project D2 for incoming trade offers in game.

Replace `notification.wav` with any other sound file that you'd prefer. `.mp3` works as well.
No way of changing volume as of right now, headphone users beware.

By default, chat logs are located in `Diablo II/ProjectD2/pd2logs/pd2_chat.log`. You should select that when the program first launches.
